This program is more or less complete.
It will be able to find a solution to any horizontal or vertical 2D array maze.

Potential Additions to Program:
1. Make it so that you can upload an array (read in CSV or text files)
2. Allow the user to choose whether or not to have a solution found horizontally or vertically
	2.a. Also allow user to create a specific coordinate (x,y) that is the endpoint of the maze
3. Print the maze output in a more "pretty" way
	3.a. Create printable graphs that takes a 2D array and prints lines/symbols based on their value
		3.a.a. For example, if you print the maze solution, you will see all the walls, paths, and 
		the solution
4. Rework the menu system (it's absolute shit) and its way to confusing (code wise!)
5. Add in functionality for Users (SQL database in C# and Visual Studio... Look that shit up)
