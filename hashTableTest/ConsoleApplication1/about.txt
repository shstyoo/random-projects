This code is designed by Seunghyun (Steve) Yoo because
Billy made me.

Shit was fun to make, and all it does is take a text file, and 
give you how many times a word appeared in the file.
Right now all it does is take the top 20, while at the same time
ignoring words that you don't want included (Such as the, what, 
who, where, why, etc...).

I can't really think of anything to implement at this time. Maybe
I'll add more stuff in later.
