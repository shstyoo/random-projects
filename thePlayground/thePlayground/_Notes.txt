--------------------------------------THOUHGTS-------------------------------------- 
11.1.2014
- Think about creating a separate class called Message specifically for your code instead of using global.message...
11.2.2014
- Decided against creating separate class for Message (shits too hard to implement)
11.5.2014
- Created the backbone for a class that can read in a text file, and display a menu according to what I need (see yellow notebook)
- Might require a little bit of time to implement (Go back to the hash table to see the File I/O that you need)
11.12.2014
- Menu structure is removed, (too difficult to implement for too little of the benefits)
- IMPORTANT GIT CHANGES!!!!
	- Added Three Branches 1. MASTER 2. consoleVer 3. windowsForm
	- MASTER: Last modified 11.12.2014
	- consoleVer: Branch of the MASTER that has a console only version of thePlayground
	- windowsForm: Branch of the MASTER that contains a windows form for database/other interactions
- Think about touching up the userAcct.cs class to better fit the console splash for the login
11.18.2014
- Basic stuff. Simple programming here and there (basic touchups)
- Programming starting on the main menu (starting to add on additional programs for user use)
----------------------------------ABOUT & CHANGELOG---------------------------------
	This program is designed for Steve (the creator) to have fun and mess around in 
visual studio as well as C#. The main purpose of this program is to test knowledge
of implementation of Databases (SQL), iteration, polymorphism, inheritance,
recursion, function overloading, encryption and algorithm searching/sorting 
(binary trees, hash tables, quickSort, mergeSort and bubbleSort[kappa]).

	Otherwise this program serves to help a user have a centralized database of 
everything they could think of. Starting with the ability to create and maintain 
an account, this program will communicate with a local database to access user
information.

User Information (as of now) contains:
-Username
-Password
-Birthday
-Secret Question
-Secret Answer
User Information (will) contain:
-Stock Portfolio Information
	-Contains and tracks stock tickers (GOOG, APPL, NYSE...etc)
-User Sensitive Information
	-Bank account (balance, info, etc...)
-General Notes
	-Will be able to save, edit, and view notes that a user might want to leave

CHANGELOG v.a.001

11.1.2014
Created C# Visual Studio Solution
- Added Launch Menu to program
- Added Error/Notification/Info message display system
- Created skeleton for the User Account
11.2.2014
Basic Maintenance
- Created a menuStructure class to control the creation/display of menus
	- Basic gist: Code that allows all other menus to follow a similar visual style so the code doesn't get ugly (output stays same)
	- If confused look towards menuStructure to see documentation
11.12.2014
New Git Branching
IMPORTANT!!!!!
- From here on out, each changelog will contain an identifier (M, C, or W) for our respective, MASTER, ConsoleVer, WindowsForm branches on GIT
- Instead of CHANGELOG v.a.001, we will have v.a.c.001, v.a.m.001, v.a.w.001 for our respective versions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGELOG v.a.c.001
11.12.2014
Basic Maintenance
- Created loginMenu() and loginLoop() for the login splash screen
	- Still need to implement reading in and outputing file (for user database)
